JSON Menu Definition Schema Overview (English)
**********************

This 'menuDefinitions/schema' folder within WebDAV holds a schema which describes the syntax of
the JSON Menu Framework menu definition files in the parent menuDefinitions folder within WebSphere Portal.
This schema is itself written in JSON,  and is based on V4 of the json-schema.org IETF draft. 

This schema is intended for use in (as input to) a schema validation tool.  While no such tool
is provided as part of WebSphere Portal, implementations do exist on the internet.  Google search
"online json schema validator" to find references to these tools.
