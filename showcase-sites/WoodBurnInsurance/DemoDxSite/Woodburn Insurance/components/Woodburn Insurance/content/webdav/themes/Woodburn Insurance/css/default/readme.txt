Theme Stylesheets
*****************

The css files in this directory are imported into master css files in this folder's parent folder. For each
file there is a filename.css, which is compressed for better performance, and a filename.css.uncompressed.css,
which is not. If you want to use the uncompressed versions of your css for development or debugging purposes,
click the Administration menu in the toolbar and select Portal Analysis. Then click Theme Analyzer, Utilities, 
Control Center and under Remote Debugging select 'Click to turn on'. Once your development/debugging is complete,
be sure to compress your changes and put them in the compressed version of the file.

The classes in these stylesheets have a default prefix of st. If you want to use a different prefix, you should
change the metadata entry simpletheme.css.class.prefix equal to the prefix you prefer, then change the classes
in these files.

The following describes each of the stylesheets in this directory

+ banner
	contains the styles that are used to display the banner at the top of the page. The banner contains the
	logo, navigation, actions menu, search, and profile menu. This is a good place to begin customizing
	the look of your theme.

+ content
	contains the styles that are used to display the content on the page.

+ footer
	contains the styles that are used to display the footer at the bottom of the page when that footer is
	generated by the st_footer dynamic content spot.

+ general
	contains some general styles such as element level styles and those that are not specific to a particular
	part of the page.

+ images
	contains the classes used to style the images, such as svg fill and size.

+ navigation
	contains the classes used to style the navigation. This includes both wide screen and mobile navigation.

+ skinLayout
	contains the classes used to style the skin and layout containers. This does not include the styles for
	the layout templates. They are located in the st_layoutGrid module.

+ utility
	contains some classes that are used throughout the page.

+ contextmenu*.css and wp_contextmenu*.css
	These are part of the menu framework and they use wptheme as a prefix instead of st. Overrides to the menu 
	framework classes are made in the contextmenuPerformance and wp_contextmenuPerformance css files.
